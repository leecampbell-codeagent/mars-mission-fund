![Mars Mission Fund](https://img.shields.io/badge/MARS_MISSION_FUND-FF5C1A?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0B1628)

A sample crowdfunding application for coding workshops.
Mars Mission Fund is a fictional product that channels collective capital toward missions, technologies, and teams taking humanity to Mars.

The project is designed to teach software engineering practices using production-grade specifications, architecture patterns, and development workflows.

## What This Repo Contains

- **Product specifications** covering vision, brand, engineering standards, architecture, security, and domain workflows (see [specs/README.md](./specs/README.md))
- **Application source code** for a TypeScript full-stack crowdfunding platform
- **Infrastructure configuration** for local development via Docker Compose

The specifications are intentionally production-grade.
They serve as working documentation and as templates demonstrating how real-world specs should be structured.
Each spec includes a "Local demo scope" note identifying what matters for the workshop versus what is theatre.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22.x LTS
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 10.x
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- Git

---

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeeCampbell/mars-mission-fund.git
cd mars-mission-fund
./scripts/run-local.sh
```

> **Note:** External services (Stripe, Clerk, Veriff, AWS SES) are stubbed or mocked for local development.
> See `.env.example` for required environment variables.

## Demo accounts

The local development seed includes three demo users for workshop use:

| Role          | Email                     | Password           |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Backer        | `backer@example.com`      | `backer-demo-pass`   |
| Creator       | `creator@example.com`     | `creator-demo-pass`  |
| Administrator | `admin@example.com`       | `admin-demo-pass`    |

To log in: open the app at `http://localhost:5173`, click **Login** in the navigation bar, enter one of the email/password pairs above, and observe the role displayed in the nav after sign-in.

These credentials are for workshop and demo use only. The JWT is stored in `localStorage` and is valid only for the local development session.
