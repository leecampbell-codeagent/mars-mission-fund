# Mars Mission Fund — Specification Index

> **Read this file first.**
> This is the authoritative index of all specifications governing the Mars Mission Fund platform.
> Before implementing any task, identify which specs govern the affected domain and read them in layer order (L1 → L4).

---

## Workshop Context

Mars Mission Fund is a **sample application for a coding workshop** — a fictional product used to teach software engineering practices.
These specifications are written to production standard as a deliberate part of the exercise: participants learn to work with real-world specification patterns, architectural trade-offs, and cross-cutting concerns.

**What is real (impacts the local demo)**:

- Tech stack choices, architecture patterns, and CQRS/Event Sourcing (L3-001, L3-008).
- Frontend standards, component architecture, and brand tokens (L2-001, L3-005).
- Domain workflows and acceptance criteria that drive implementation (L4 specs).
- Code quality gates, testing standards, and linting (L2-002, L3-007).
- Audit event schema and event store design (L3-006).

**What is theatre (production-realistic but not implemented locally)**:

- Multi-environment deployment (staging, production) — local Docker only.
- Disaster recovery, failover, on-call rotations, and SLA enforcement (L3-003).
- Penetration testing, security incident response, and breach notification (L3-002).
- PCI DSS compliance processes, GDPR operational workflows (L3-002, L3-006).
- Data residency, cross-border transfers, and tiered storage automation (L3-004, L3-006).
- External provider integrations (KYC, payment gateway, email, search) — stubbed or mocked.
- Secrets management service, certificate management — environment variables for local dev.

The specifications are intentionally production-grade.
They serve as working documentation for the demo and as templates demonstrating how real-world specs should be structured.
Each spec includes a **Local demo scope** note identifying what matters for the workshop.

## Agent Protocol

1. **Before any implementation task**, read this index to identify governing specs.
1. **Read specs top-down**: L1 → L2 → relevant L3 → relevant L4. Higher layers take precedence.
1. **Never contradict a higher-layer spec.** If a lower-layer spec conflicts with a higher one, flag it as a blocking issue and reference both documents.
1. **Cross-reference dependencies.** Each spec lists what it depends on and what depends on it. Follow these links to ensure changes don't break downstream specs.
1. **Check rate of change.** Specs with a slow rate of change require change request approval before modification. Specs with a fast rate of change can be updated with standard review.

## Specification Hierarchy

### L1 — Strategic (changes quarterly or at major pivots)

| Spec ID | Document                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                  | Status   |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| L1-001  | `product-vision-and-mission.md` | Root document. Defines why we exist, who we serve, what we build, and what we don't. All other specs must align with the vision, mission, principles, and scope boundaries defined here. | Approved |

**Governance**: Changes to L1 require product leadership approval and trigger a review of all downstream specs for alignment.

---

### L2 — Standards (changes monthly or at standard reviews)

| Spec ID | Document                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Depends On                      | Status   |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| L2-001  | `standards/brand.md`       | How the MMF brand system (colours, typography, voice, motion) is applied within the product. References the HTML brand guidelines as the source of truth for design tokens. Specifies product-specific application rules, component-to-token mappings, accessibility requirements, and voice-in-product patterns. Does not duplicate brand guidelines. | L1-001, Brand Guidelines (HTML) | Approved |
| L2-002  | `standards/engineering.md` | The engineering constitution. Codifies non-negotiable technical decisions: security-first architecture, parameterised queries only, encryption standards, testing requirements, code quality gates, and dependency management policies. All L3 and L4 specs inherit these constraints.                                                                 | L1-001                          | Approved |

**Governance**: Changes to L2 require engineering and design leadership review. Changes to L2-002 trigger a review of all L3 specs.

## Document Conventions

All specs in this ecosystem follow these conventions:

- **Spec ID**: Every document has a unique ID (e.g., L3-002) used for cross-referencing.
- **Frontmatter metadata**: Each spec includes spec ID, version, status, rate of change, depends-on list, and depended-on-by list.
- **Acceptance criteria**: L4 domain specs must include explicit, testable acceptance criteria for every workflow.
- **Interface contracts**: Where specs share boundaries (e.g., payments ↔ campaign), both specs must define the interface contract and reference each other.
- **Change log**: Every spec maintains a change log with date, author, and summary of changes.
- **Status values**: `Not Started` → `Draft` → `Review` → `Approved` → `Superseded`
