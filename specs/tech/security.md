## 1. Purpose

> **Local demo scope**: RBAC model, authentication via Clerk, input validation, CSP headers, and the STRIDE threat model structure are **real** — they inform the local demo's auth implementation. Penetration testing, incident response procedures, breach notification workflows, certificate management, and compliance audit cadences are theatre. Session timeouts and lockout thresholds will use sensible defaults without formal review.

This spec defines the security architecture for Mars Mission Fund: threat model, control matrix, authentication and authorisation architecture, encryption standards, compliance mapping, session management, and incident response.
It implements the "Security as Foundation" principle from the [Product Vision & Mission](L1-001) and the security invariants defined in the [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 1.

**What this spec governs**:

- Threat model and security control matrix.
- Authentication architecture (OAuth 2.0 / OIDC, MFA).
- Authorisation architecture (RBAC model, five roles).
- Encryption standards and certificate management.
- Session management (token lifecycle, expiry, revocation).
- Compliance mapping (PCI DSS, GDPR, Australian Privacy Act).
- Penetration testing and security review cadence.
- Incident response plan (security-specific).
- Content Security Policy and security headers.

**What this spec does NOT cover**:

- System topology, service boundaries, and deployment — see [Architecture](L3-001).
- Data classification, retention, and anonymisation rules — see [Data Management](L3-004).
- Audit event schemas, log immutability, and retention — see [Audit](L3-006).
- Availability targets, failover, and operational incident response — see [Reliability](L3-003).
- Domain-specific payment security (PCI DSS SAQ-A boundary details) — see [Payments](L4-004).
- KYC document handling and identity verification — see [KYC](L4-005).

## 3. Threat Model

This section uses the STRIDE framework to categorise threats against Mars Mission Fund.
The threat model is a living document — it must be reviewed and updated whenever the system architecture changes or a new domain is added.

### 3.1 Threat Categories

## 4. Authentication Architecture

### 4.1 Protocol

Authentication is based on OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC) for identity.

- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Clerk (per [Tech Stack](L3-008)).
  Clerk provides OAuth 2.0/OIDC, session management, and MFA capabilities as a managed service.
- All user authentication flows use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).
- Implicit flow and Resource Owner Password Credentials flow are prohibited.

### 4.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 1.5, MFA is required for:

- All financial actions (contributions, disbursements, refunds).
- All administrative operations (role assignment, campaign approval, system configuration).
- Account recovery.
- Changes to authentication settings (password change, MFA method change).

Supported MFA methods:

| Method                              | Use Case                                                | Notes                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) | Primary MFA method for all users                        | MUST comply with RFC 6238; 30-second time step; SHA-256 minimum |
| WebAuthn / FIDO2                    | Recommended for administrative and high-privilege users | Hardware security keys and platform authenticators supported    |
| Recovery codes                      | Account recovery when primary MFA is unavailable        | Single-use; 10 codes generated at MFA enrolment; stored hashed  |

SMS-based OTP is not supported as an MFA method due to known vulnerabilities (SIM swapping, SS7 attacks).

### 4.3 Token Architecture

| Token Type    | Purpose                                             | Lifetime             | Storage                                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access token  | Authorises API requests                             | 5 minutes            | Memory only (never persisted to disk or local storage)                           |
| Refresh token | Obtains new access tokens without re-authentication | 1 day                | Secure, HttpOnly cookie; server-side reference validated against revocation list |
| ID token      | Carries identity claims (OIDC)                      | Same as access token | Memory only                                                                      |

- Access tokens are JWTs signed with RS256 (minimum 2048-bit RSA) or ES256.
- The API Gateway validates token signatures, expiry, and issuer before forwarding requests to domain services per [Architecture](L3-001), Section 3.2.
- Tokens include the user's role claims for authorisation enforcement (see Section 5).

### 4.4 Session Management

- Sessions are bound to a single device/user-agent.
- Concurrent session limit: unlimited. Users may have any number of active sessions across devices.
- Session revocation is immediate upon: password change, MFA method change, account deactivation, explicit logout, or administrator-initiated revocation.
- Idle session timeout: 15 minutes of inactivity.
- Absolute session timeout: 8 hours regardless of activity.
- All active sessions are visible to the user in their account settings, with the ability to revoke individual sessions.

### 4.5 Account Lockout

- After 3 consecutive failed authentication attempts, the account is temporarily locked.
- Lockout duration escalates with repeated lockouts (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour).
- Account lockout events are logged as security events and trigger alerts per [Audit](L3-006).
- Lockout resets after successful authentication or administrator intervention.
- Lockout applies per-account, not per-IP, to prevent credential stuffing without enabling account denial-of-service at the IP level.

## 5. Authorisation Architecture

### 5.1 RBAC Model

Mars Mission Fund uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with five roles defined in the [Product Vision & Mission](L1-001):

| Role                    | Description                                       | Typical Capabilities                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Backer**              | A user who contributes funds to campaigns         | Browse campaigns, make contributions, view own contribution history, manage own profile                                              |
| **Creator**             | A user who creates and manages campaigns          | All Backer capabilities + create campaigns, manage own campaigns, define milestones, request disbursements                           |
| **Reviewer**            | A user who reviews and approves/rejects campaigns | All Backer capabilities + review submitted campaigns, approve/reject, request changes                                                |
| **Administrator**       | A user who manages platform operations            | All Reviewer capabilities + manage users, assign roles (except Super Administrator), view audit logs, manage platform settings       |
| **Super Administrator** | Highest-privilege platform user                   | All Administrator capabilities + assign Administrator/Super Administrator roles, access compliance reports, manage security settings |

### 5.2 Role Assignment Rules

- New users are assigned the Backer role by default upon registration.
- Creator role is granted after KYC verification — see [KYC](L4-005).
- Reviewer role is assigned by an Administrator or Super Administrator.
- Administrator role is assigned by a Super Administrator only.
- Super Administrator role is assigned by another Super Administrator only, with MFA confirmation from both parties.
- Role changes are logged as security-critical audit events per [Audit](L3-006).

### 5.3 Permission Enforcement

- Authorisation is enforced at the API layer, not the UI layer.
  The UI may hide elements based on role, but the API must independently validate permissions on every request.
- Permissions are evaluated against the role claims in the access token (Section 4.3).
- Resource-level authorisation (e.g., "this Creator can only manage their own campaigns") is enforced by the domain service, not the API Gateway.
- All authorisation failures are logged with: actor identity, requested resource, requested action, and the reason for denial.

### 5.4 Service-to-Service Authorisation

- Each service has a unique identity per [Architecture](L3-001), Section 6.3.
- Per [Architecture](L3-001), the current deployment is a single unit, making service-to-service authentication not applicable. If services are split in future, JWT service tokens are the recommended mechanism (see [Architecture](L3-001), Open Question 6).
- Service authorisation policies follow the principle of least privilege: each service is authorised only for the specific endpoints it needs to call.
- Service authorisation policies are defined declaratively and version-controlled.

---

## 6. Encryption Standards

### 6.1 Encryption at Rest

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 1.1:

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256.
- "Sensitive data" classification is defined in [Data Management](L3-004).
  At minimum: PII, financial data, authentication credentials, KYC documents.
- Encryption key management: AWS KMS. Note: this is a workshop project and will not reach production; AWS KMS is selected for consistency with the AWS-based tech stack.
- Key rotation policy: encryption keys must be rotated at least annually, or immediately upon suspected compromise.
- Envelope encryption is used where supported: data is encrypted with a data encryption key (DEK), and the DEK is encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK) managed by the KMS.

### 6.2 Encryption in Transit

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 1.1:

- All communication uses TLS 1.3 (minimum).
  TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 are not supported.
- No exceptions for internal service-to-service communication.
- TLS termination occurs at the API Gateway for external traffic per [Architecture](L3-001), Section 3.2.
- Internal service-to-service communication uses TLS regardless of whether a service mesh provides it — defence in depth.
- Certificate management: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for automated certificate provisioning and renewal.

### 6.3 Secrets Management

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Sections 1.3 and 7.3:

- All secrets (API keys, database credentials, encryption keys, signing certificates) are managed through the secrets management service recorded in [Architecture](L3-001), Section 8.
- Secrets are injected at runtime via environment variables.
- Secrets are never committed to version control, logged, passed as CLI arguments, or written to disk by application code.
- Secret rotation must be possible without application redeployment.
- Applications must handle secret rotation gracefully (re-read on expiry, not crash).
- Secret access is logged as an audit event.

---

## 7. Input Validation & Security Headers

### 7.1 Input Validation

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 1.4:

- All external input is validated, sanitised, and type-checked at the system boundary before any processing.
- "External" includes: user input, API requests, webhook payloads, file uploads, URL parameters, and any data originating outside the trust boundary.
- Validation rules:
  - Accept-list (allowlist) validation is preferred over deny-list (blocklist).
  - String inputs are length-limited and character-set restricted where the domain allows.
  - Numeric inputs are range-checked.
  - File uploads are validated for type (magic bytes, not just extension), size, and content.
  - Uploaded files are stored in a separate domain from the application per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 1.4.

### 7.2 Security Headers

All web responses must include the following security headers:

| Header                      | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Purpose                              |

### 7.3 Rate Limiting

- Rate limiting is enforced at the API Gateway per [Architecture](L3-001), Section 3.2.
- Rate limits apply per-user (authenticated) and per-IP (unauthenticated pre-auth endpoints).
- Rate limit thresholds (per user or per IP for unauthenticated endpoints):
  - General API endpoints: 100 requests per minute.
  - Authentication endpoints (login, register, password reset): 10 requests per minute.
  - Financial action endpoints (contribute, disburse, refund): 20 requests per minute.
  - These thresholds are sized for a B2C application serving tens to low thousands of users.
- Authentication endpoints have stricter rate limits to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- Rate limit responses include `Retry-After` headers per HTTP standards.

## 8. Compliance Mapping

### 8.1 PCI DSS

Mars Mission Fund targets **SAQ-A** compliance scope by delegating all cardholder data handling to the payment gateway.

Payment gateway: **Stripe** (per [Payments](L4-004) and [Tech Stack](L3-008)).
Client-side tokenisation via **Stripe Elements** — the platform never stores, processes, or transmits raw cardholder data.

| SAQ-A Requirement                                                             | Implementation                                                                                                  | Spec Reference                             |

## 9. Session Management

> This section expands on the token and session architecture defined in Section 4.3 and 4.4.

### 9.1 Token Lifecycle

```text
[User authenticates] → [Access token + Refresh token issued]
        │
        ├── Access token expires → [Refresh token used to obtain new access token]
        │                                   │
        │                                   ├── Refresh token valid → [New access + refresh token pair issued]
        │                                   └── Refresh token expired/revoked → [Re-authentication required]
        │
        ├── Security event (password change, MFA change) → [All tokens revoked; re-authentication required]
        │
        └── Explicit logout → [Access + refresh tokens revoked]
```

### 9.2 Token Revocation

- A server-side revocation list (or equivalent mechanism) tracks revoked tokens.
- The API Gateway checks the revocation list on every request.
- Revocation is propagated within 30 seconds across all gateway instances.
- Revocation events are logged as security audit events per [Audit](L3-006).

### 9.3 Refresh Token Rotation

- Refresh tokens are rotated on every use: when a refresh token is exchanged for a new access token, a new refresh token is also issued and the previous one is invalidated.
- If a previously invalidated refresh token is presented, all tokens for that session are revoked (potential token theft detected).

## 10. Incident Response Plan

This section covers security-specific incident response.
Operational incident response (availability, performance degradation) is defined in [Reliability](L3-003).

### 10.1 Severity Classification

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Active breach, data exfiltration, or exploitation in progress                                | Unauthorised access to PII or financial data, payment system compromise, credential leak | Immediate (within 15 minutes) |
| **High**     | Confirmed vulnerability being actively exploited or high likelihood of imminent exploitation | Unpatched critical CVE in production, privilege escalation vulnerability discovered      | Within 1 hour                 |
| **Medium**   | Vulnerability identified, not yet exploited; security control degradation                    | Failed penetration test finding, misconfigured security header, expired certificate      | Within 24 hours               |
| **Low**      | Minor security improvement or hardening opportunity                                          | Non-critical dependency update, security best practice recommendation                    | Within 1 sprint               |

### 10.2 Response Process

1. **Detection & Triage**: Security event detected via monitoring, audit log analysis, or external report.
   Assign severity.
   Notify the security incident response team.
1. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems.
   Revoke compromised credentials.
   Block malicious actors at the network edge.
1. **Investigation**: Determine scope of impact, root cause, and affected data/users.
   Preserve forensic evidence (logs, snapshots).
1. **Remediation**: Fix the vulnerability or close the attack vector.
   Deploy patches.
   Rotate affected secrets.
1. **Recovery**: Restore affected services to normal operation.
   Verify integrity of affected data.
1. **Post-incident review**: Conduct a blameless post-mortem within 5 business days.
   Document findings, root cause, and preventive actions.
   Update threat model (Section 3) if new threats were identified.

### 10.3 Breach Notification

- **GDPR (Art. 33)**: Supervisory authority notified within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach involving personal data.
- **GDPR (Art. 34)**: Affected individuals notified without undue delay if breach is likely to result in high risk.
- **Australian Notifiable Data Breaches scheme**: OAIC and affected individuals notified as soon as practicable after becoming aware of an eligible data breach.
- Notification templates are maintained in the incident response runbook and include: affected data summary, remediation steps taken, contact information for further enquiries, and regulatory body references.
- Escalation chain: Engineering Lead → Security Lead → CTO → Legal Counsel → CEO. All escalation contacts are maintained in an internal directory with backup contacts.

## 12. Interface Contracts

### 12.1 Security <> Architecture (L3-001)

- [Architecture](L3-001) defines the service topology, API Gateway, and communication patterns.
  This spec defines the authentication/authorisation mechanisms, token formats, and encryption that operate within that topology.
- [Architecture](L3-001) defines the API Gateway as the TLS termination and token validation point.
  This spec defines the token format, validation rules, and MFA enforcement at the gateway.
- Service identity mechanism is jointly owned: [Architecture](L3-001) defines the pattern; this spec defines the credentials, trust model, and authorisation policies.
- Reference: [Architecture](L3-001), Section 11.1.

### 12.2 Security <> Data Management (L3-004)

- This spec defines encryption standards and access controls.
  [Data Management](L3-004) defines the data classification scheme that determines which data requires encryption and at what level.
- GDPR compliance mapping (Section 8.2) references data retention, anonymisation, and data lifecycle policies owned by [Data Management](L3-004).
- Data access logging requirements are jointly owned: this spec defines what constitutes a security-relevant access event; [Data Management](L3-004) defines access patterns per classification level.

### 12.3 Security <> Audit (L3-006)

- This spec defines which events are security-critical and must be logged (authentication attempts, authorisation failures, role changes, token revocations, security incidents).
- [Audit](L3-006) defines the immutable logging architecture, event schema, retention policies, and access controls on audit data.
- Incident response (Section 10) depends on audit log availability and integrity guaranteed by [Audit](L3-006).

### 12.4 Security <> Reliability (L3-003)

- Incident response is split: this spec owns security incident response (Section 10); [Reliability](L3-003) owns operational incident response.
- DDoS mitigation and rate limiting (Section 7.3) overlap with availability protection defined in [Reliability](L3-003).

### 12.5 Security <> Account (L4-001)

- This spec defines the authentication and session architecture.
  [Account](L4-001) implements the user-facing registration, login, MFA enrolment, password management, and session visibility workflows.
- Role assignment rules (Section 5.2) are enforced by [Account](L4-001).

### 12.6 Security <> Payments (L4-004)

- This spec defines the PCI DSS SAQ-A compliance boundary (Section 8.1).
  [Payments](L4-004) implements the payment tokenisation, gateway integration, and cardholder data isolation that maintain that boundary.
- MFA requirement for financial actions (Section 4.2) is enforced in payment flows defined by [Payments](L4-004).

### 12.7 Security <> KYC (L4-005)

- This spec defines encryption and access control requirements for identity documents.
  [KYC](L4-005) implements the document handling, storage, and verification workflows.
- Creator role grant depends on KYC verification (Section 5.2).
  [KYC](L4-005) defines the verification lifecycle and triggers.
- GDPR and Australian Privacy Act compliance for identity data is jointly owned between this spec, [Data Management](L3-004), and [KYC](L4-005).
