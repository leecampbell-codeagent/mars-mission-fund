## 1. Purpose

> **Local demo scope**: Service boundaries, CQRS/Event Sourcing pattern, REST API design, feature flag framework, and the hexagonal architecture pattern are **real** — they drive the local demo's implementation. Multi-environment deployment, infrastructure topology diagrams, and service discovery are theatre. The local demo uses `docker-compose.dev.yml` to start the PostgreSQL database only; the Express server (`packages/server/`) is run separately with `npm run dev:server` from the repo root (or `npm run dev` inside `packages/server/`) — it is not part of the Docker Compose stack.

This spec defines the system architecture for Mars Mission Fund: service boundaries, data model overview, inter-service communication patterns, infrastructure topology, deployment strategy, and cross-cutting technical frameworks (ADRs, feature flags, linting).

**What this spec governs**:

- High-level system structure and service decomposition.
- Inter-service communication contracts and patterns.
- Infrastructure and deployment topology.
- Technology selection registry and ADR process.
- Feature flag framework.
- Linting and formatting rulesets.
- API versioning scheme and error response format.

**What this spec does NOT cover**:

- Threat models and security controls — see [Security](L3-002).
- Availability targets, failover, and disaster recovery — see [Reliability](L3-003).
- Data classification, retention, and lifecycle — see [Data Management](L3-004).
- Frontend component architecture and browser support — see [Frontend Standards](L3-005).
- Audit event schemas and log retention — see [Audit](L3-006).

## 3. Service Boundaries & Responsibilities

The system is decomposed into services aligned with the L4 domain boundaries.
Each service owns its data, exposes a well-defined API, and communicates with other services through the patterns defined in Section 6.

### 3.1 Domain Services

| Service          | Governing Spec     | Responsibilities                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account Service  | [Account](L4-001)  | User registration, authentication, profile management, role assignment, session management, account recovery         |
| Campaign Service | [Campaign](L4-002) | Project submission, review pipeline, campaign lifecycle, milestone tracking, deadline enforcement, fund settlement   |
| Donor Service    | [Donor](L4-003)    | Project discovery, recommendations, contribution flow orchestration, impact reporting, donor relationship management |
| Payment Service  | [Payments](L4-004) | Payment gateway integration, tokenisation, escrow, disbursement, refunds, reconciliation, tax receipts               |
| KYC Service      | [KYC](L4-005)      | Identity verification, document handling, sanctions screening, verification lifecycle                                |

### 3.2 Shared / Platform Services

| Service                                    | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Gateway                                | Request routing, rate limiting, authentication token validation, correlation ID injection, TLS termination                                                          |
| Notification Service                       | Email, push, and in-app notification delivery; template management; delivery tracking                                                                               |
| Audit Service                              | Append-only event ingestion, storage, and query — see [Audit](L3-006). Event sourcing provides a natural audit trail; the Audit Service reads from the event store. |
| Search Service                             | Full-text search over campaigns, projects, and public profiles — backed by PostgreSQL full-text search over CQRS read models. No external search provider required. |
| Feature Flag & Analytics Service (PostHog) | Feature flags, product analytics, and web analytics — see Section 9                                                                                                 |
| Secrets Management Service                 | Secret storage, injection, and rotation — see Section 8                                                                                                             |

### 3.3 External Integration Adapters

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 2.4, every external dependency is accessed through an internal adapter interface.

| Adapter                 | External Provider                                                                           | Consuming Services            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Payment Gateway Adapter | Stripe (per L3-008)                                                                         | Payment Service               |
| KYC Provider Adapter    | Veriff (stubbed/mocked for local demo)                                                      | KYC Service                   |
| Email Delivery Adapter  | AWS SES                                                                                     | Notification Service          |
| Object Storage Adapter  | AWS S3 (per L3-008 — S3 used for frontend assets, audit cold storage, and document uploads) | KYC Service, Campaign Service |

Each adapter exposes an internal interface contract.
The concrete provider implementation is swappable without changes to consuming code.

## 4. Data Model Overview

### 4.1 Data Ownership

Each domain service owns its data store.
No service reads from or writes to another service's data store directly.
Cross-service data access occurs only through published API contracts or consumed events.

Detailed data classification, retention, and lifecycle policies are defined in [Data Management](L3-004).

### 4.2 Data Access Layer

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 1.2, all data access goes through a data access layer that enforces:

- Parameterised queries exclusively (no string concatenation in query construction).
- Access control validation (the calling identity has permission to access the requested resource).
- Structured logging of all data access operations (resource ID, action, actor — never raw PII).

The data access layer uses raw SQL via pg (parameterised queries) — no ORM or query builder.

### 4.3 Data Model Diagram

Data model will emerge as domain requirements are discovered and implemented.
Entity-relationship diagram to be added once core aggregates are stabilised.

---

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment Topology

### 5.1 Environment Topology

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 7.1, three environments exist with structural parity:

| Environment | Purpose                                                             | Scale            | Data                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Development | Local and CI-based development and testing                          | Minimal replicas | Synthetic / seeded               |
| Staging     | Pre-production validation, integration testing, performance testing | Reduced replicas | Synthetic, representative volume |
| Production  | Live traffic                                                        | Full scale       | Real                             |

All environments share the same service topology, network layout, and configuration shape.
Differences are limited to scale, data, and secrets.

### 5.2 Infrastructure Diagram

Infrastructure diagram to be added once deployment topology is stabilised.
Will cover: edge layer, API gateway, services, data stores, event bus, external integrations, and observability stack.

### 5.3 Deployment Pipeline

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 7.4:

- Every deployment is automated from merge-to-main through to production, with explicit approval gates per Section 4.5 of the [Engineering Standard](L2-002).
- Every deployment is reproducible: same commit hash and configuration produces identical artefacts.
- Rollback to the previous version is possible within 15 minutes with no data loss.
- Database migrations are backward-compatible: the previous application version must function against the new schema.

The CI/CD platform is recorded in the Technology Selection Registry (Section 8).

### 5.4 Container & Orchestration Strategy

- **Containerisation**: Single Docker container deployed to AWS ECS Fargate.
- **Deployment unit**: All domain services run within one deployment unit (monolithic deployment, modular internal architecture via hexagonal architecture per [Tech Stack](L3-008)).
- **Load balancing**: Behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for health checks, TLS termination, and request routing.
- **Frontend**: Served via CloudFront CDN with S3 origin (per [Tech Stack](L3-008)).

---

## 6. Inter-Service Communication

### 6.1 Synchronous Communication

Synchronous (request/response) communication is used when the caller requires an immediate response to proceed.

- **Protocol**: REST over HTTPS.
- **Service discovery**: Not required — all services run within a single deployment unit. If services are split in the future, ECS Service Connect (AWS Cloud Map) is the natural fit.
- **Timeout and retry policy**: Every synchronous call must define a timeout.
  Retry policies must use exponential backoff with jitter.
  Circuit breaker patterns are defined in [Reliability](L3-003).

#### API Versioning

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 5.1, all APIs are versioned from day one.

- **Scheme**: URL path versioning (`/v1/resource`).
- **Deprecation periods**: Minimum 90 days for external APIs, 30 days for internal APIs per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 5.1.

#### Success Response Envelope

All successful API responses are wrapped in a `data` envelope:

- Single-resource endpoints return `{ "data": { ... } }`.
- Collection endpoints return `{ "data": [ ... ] }`.

```json
{ "data": { "id": "...", "title": "..." } }
```

```json
{ "data": [ { "id": "...", "title": "..." }, { "id": "...", "title": "..." } ] }
```

This envelope is implemented in `packages/server/src/campaigns/routes.ts` (`res.json({ data: ... })`).

#### Field Naming Convention

- DB columns use `snake_case` (PostgreSQL convention).
- All API JSON responses use `camelCase` field names.
- The server query layer is responsible for aliasing column names before returning data to routes
  (e.g. `SELECT min_funding_target_usd AS "minFundingTargetUsd" FROM ...`).
- Shared Zod schemas in `@mmf/shared` must use camelCase to match API responses.

#### Error Response Format

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 5.3, all APIs use a consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "<MACHINE_READABLE_ERROR_CODE>",
    "message": "<Human-readable message suitable for display>",
    "correlation_id": "<Request correlation ID>",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

- `code`: A stable, machine-readable identifier (e.g., `CAMPAIGN_NOT_FOUND`, `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`). Not an HTTP status code.
- `message`: Follows voice-in-product patterns from [Brand Standard](L2-001).
- `correlation_id`: The correlation ID assigned at the edge per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 6.2.
- `details`: Optional structured context to help the caller understand and resolve the error. Must never contain internal implementation details or sensitive data.

### 6.2 Asynchronous Communication

Asynchronous (event-driven) communication is used when:

- The caller does not need an immediate response.
- Multiple consumers need to react to the same event.
- Temporal decoupling improves system resilience.

#### CQRS & Event Sourcing

- **Pattern**: Commands mutate state by appending events to the event store. Queries read from materialised read models. This separation allows independent scaling and optimisation of write and read paths.
- **Event Store**: PostgreSQL (Aurora) — events are append-only rows in a dedicated events table per aggregate. No separate message broker is required.
- **Event schema**: All events follow a common envelope:

```json
{
  "event_id": "<UUID>",
  "event_type": "<DOMAIN>.<ACTION>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "correlation_id": "<Request correlation ID>",
  "source_service": "<Emitting service name>",
  "payload": {}
}
```

- **Read Model Populators**: Pull events from the event store and project them into read-optimised views (PostgreSQL tables or materialised views). All populators are idempotent — replaying events produces the same read model state.
- **Process Managers**: Coordinate cross-aggregate workflows by consuming events and issuing commands. Process managers maintain their own state and are idempotent.
- **Delivery guarantees**: At-least-once. All consumers are idempotent. Consumption is pull-based — populators and process managers poll the event store for new events using a stored checkpoint.
- **Schema evolution**: Events follow backward-compatible evolution rules mirroring [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 5.2 (new fields may be added; existing fields must not be removed or changed).

### 6.3 Service Identity & Authentication

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 1.5, every service-to-service call is authenticated.

- **Mechanism**: Not applicable — single deployment unit, all inter-service calls are in-process. If services are split in the future, JWT service tokens are recommended, aligning with the custom stateless JWT implementation already in use for user authentication (see [Security](L3-002) and [Tech Stack](L3-008)).
- Each service has a unique identity.
  No service impersonates another.
- Authorisation policies define which services can call which endpoints.

---

## 7. Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Process

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 3.1, architectural decisions affecting multiple services follow a structured ADR process.

### 7.1 When an ADR Is Required

- Introducing a new service or removing an existing one.
- Changing inter-service communication patterns or protocols.
- Selecting or replacing a technology in the Technology Selection Registry.
- Modifying service boundaries or data ownership.
- Any decision that changes the interface contract between two or more services.

### 7.2 ADR Template

Each ADR is stored in `specs/adrs/` with the filename `NNNN-<short-title>.md`:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: <Title>

> **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX
> **Date**: <YYYY-MM-DD>
> **Deciders**: <list of people involved>

## Context

What is the issue or decision we need to make? What forces are at play?

## Decision

What is the decision and why?

## Consequences

What are the positive, negative, and neutral consequences of this decision?

## Compliance

Which spec constraints (L2-002 sections, L3 constraints) does this decision satisfy or affect?
```

### 7.3 ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Author creates the ADR and opens a PR. The PR description links to the ADR.
1. **Review**: Peer review from at least one engineer outside the proposing team, per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 3.1.
1. **Accepted**: Merged to main. The decision is binding.
1. **Superseded**: A new ADR explicitly supersedes this one. The old ADR is updated with a pointer to the new one.

## 8. Technology Selection Registry

All approved technology choices are recorded here.
New entries require a vendor evaluation per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 2.5 and an ADR per Section 7.

## 9. Feature Flag Framework

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Sections 4.5 and 7.2:

- Feature flags are the default deployment mechanism for user-facing changes.
- Feature flags are runtime-configurable without deployment.
- Feature flags are managed through PostHog (not environment variables).

### 9.1 Flag Lifecycle

| Stage         | Description                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Created       | Flag registered in the feature flag service with a default-off state                     |
| Development   | Flag used to gate in-progress work; enabled only in development and staging              |
| Rollout       | Flag enabled incrementally in production (percentage-based, user-segment, or allow-list) |
| Fully enabled | Flag enabled for all users; code path without the flag is verified as unused             |
| Removed       | Flag and conditional code removed in a follow-up PR; dead code is not acceptable         |

### 9.2 Flag Naming Convention

Flags use kebab-case keys following the pattern `<domain>-<feature>`:

- `campaign-milestone-tracking`
- `donor-impact-dashboard`
- `payment-crypto-support`

### 9.3 Flag Ownership

Every flag has an owner (team or individual) and a planned removal date.
Flags that exceed their planned lifetime are flagged in a regular cleanup review.

## 10. Linting & Formatting

Per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 4.1, all code passes automated linting and formatting checks before review.
Formatting is never a review discussion — it is automated.

### 10.1 Rulesets Per Language

| Language   | Linter               | Formatter | Configuration                      |
| ---------- | -------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| TypeScript | ESLint (flat config) | Prettier  | `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`  |
| Markdown   | markdownlint-cli2    | —         | `.markdownlint.jsonc` (per L3-007) |

### 10.2 Enforcement

- Linting and formatting checks run in CI on every PR per [Engineering Standard](L2-002), Section 4.4.
- Pre-commit hooks are available for local development but CI is the authoritative gate.
- Auto-formatting is applied on save in recommended IDE configurations.

## 11. Interface Contracts

This spec shares boundaries with every other L3 spec and several L4 specs.

### 11.1 Architecture <> Security (L3-002)

- This spec defines the service topology and communication patterns.
  [Security](L3-002) defines the threat model, authentication/authorisation mechanisms, and encryption implementations that operate within this topology.
- This spec defines the API Gateway as the TLS termination and token validation point.
  [Security](L3-002) defines the token format, validation rules, and MFA requirements.
- Service identity mechanism (Section 6.3) is jointly owned: this spec defines the pattern; [Security](L3-002) defines the credentials and trust model.

### 11.2 Architecture <> Reliability (L3-003)

- This spec defines the service topology and deployment pipeline.
  [Reliability](L3-003) defines availability targets, failover strategies, circuit breaker configurations, and health check contracts that apply to every service in this topology.
- The deployment rollback requirement (15 minutes, Section 5.3) is jointly owned with [Reliability](L3-003).

### 11.3 Architecture <> Data Management (L3-004)

- This spec establishes per-service data ownership (Section 4.1).
  [Data Management](L3-004) defines the data classification scheme, retention policies, anonymisation rules, and migration strategies that apply to each service's data store.
- The data access layer (Section 4.2) enforces parameterised queries and access logging.
  [Data Management](L3-004) defines what data is classified at each level and the access rules per classification.

### 11.4 Architecture <> Frontend Standards (L3-005)

- This spec defines the API Gateway and backend service contracts that the frontend consumes.
  [Frontend Standards](L3-005) defines the frontend architecture, component standards, and performance budgets for the client layer.
- The error response format (Section 6.1) is consumed by the frontend.
  [Frontend Standards](L3-005) defines how errors are presented to users, implementing the voice-in-product patterns from [Brand Standard](L2-001).

### 11.5 Architecture <> Audit (L3-006)

- This spec defines the Audit Service as a shared platform service (Section 3.2).
  [Audit](L3-006) defines the audit event schema, immutability guarantees, retention policies, and access controls.
- The event envelope (Section 6.2) provides the base structure.
  [Audit](L3-006) extends this with audit-specific fields and ingestion contracts.

| 2026-03-09 | 0.4     | —      | Clarified local demo topology in Section 1: `docker-compose.dev.yml` starts PostgreSQL only; the Express server (`server/`) is run separately via `npm run dev` — it is not part of the Docker Compose stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2026-03-10 | 0.5     | —      | Corrected Section 1 local demo scope note: updated Express server path from `server/` to `packages/server/` and run command to `npm run dev:server` from the repo root (or `npm run dev` inside `packages/server/`), reflecting the completed npm workspaces monorepo restructuring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
