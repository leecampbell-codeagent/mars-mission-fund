# Tech Stack

> **Spec ID:** L3-008
> **Version:** 0.4.0
> **Status:** Approved
> **Rate of change:** Slow (changes at major technology decisions)
> **Depends on:** L1-001, L2-002, L3-001
> **Depended on by:** All L3 and L4 specs (technology baseline)

---

## Purpose

> **Local demo scope**: All technology choices in this document are **real** and used in the local demo. Cloud infrastructure (ECS Fargate, CloudFront, ECR, Terraform Cloud) is replaced by Docker Compose for local development. The local demo uses the same languages, frameworks, and libraries listed here.

This document enumerates the technology choices for the Mars Mission Fund platform.
It serves as the single source of truth for languages, frameworks, libraries, infrastructure, and tooling.

## Local Development

`docker-compose.dev.yml` provides the local development backing services.

### Docker Compose

- Runs `postgres:16-alpine` on port **5432** for local development.
- Only the database is managed by Docker Compose; the Express server is run separately (see below).

### Database Migrations (DBMate)

- DBMate applies migrations from `packages/server/db/migrations/`.
- Invoke via a local DBMate install or:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm --network host \
    -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." \
    -v "$(pwd)/packages/server/db:/db" \
    ghcr.io/amacneil/dbmate up
  ```

- Migration file naming convention: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_<snake_case_description>.sql`
  (e.g. `20260301120000_create_campaigns.sql`).

### Express Server

Run separately from Docker Compose:

```sh
npm run dev:server
```

### Server Directory Layout

```text
packages/server/
└── src/
    ├── campaigns/     # Campaign domain handlers and routes
    ├── db/            # Database client, migration helpers, migrations/
    ├── middleware/     # Express middleware (logging, error handling)
    └── __tests__/     # Integration and unit tests
```

## Testing

| Technology                | Version       | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Vitest                    | Latest stable | Unit and integration test runner                 |
| SuperTest                 | Latest stable | HTTP assertion library for API tests             |
| @testing-library/react    | Latest stable | React component testing utilities                |
| MSW (Mock Service Worker) | Latest stable | API mocking for frontend tests                   |
| Playwright                | Latest stable | End-to-end browser tests (root `e2e/` directory) |

### Playwright CI Requirements

The Playwright E2E suite requires the following CI environment setup (introduced by issue #66):

- A `postgres:16-alpine` service must be running before the suite starts.
- DBMate migrations must run against the CI database before the test suite executes.
- A seed SQL script must be applied to the CI database before E2E tests run.
- Playwright configuration lives at `e2e/playwright.config.ts`; tests live at `e2e/*.spec.ts`.

### Quality Gates

- Unit test coverage: 90%+ for business logic / domain
- Integration tests must pass
- E2E tests must pass

---

## Architecture Pattern

**Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) for clean separation between domain logic and infrastructure concerns.
